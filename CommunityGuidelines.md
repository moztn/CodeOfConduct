## Guidelines

The Mozilla community is for people who are interested in the Mozilla project and the Mozilla mission; everything from translating, teaching the web, speaking at conferences, coding and designing to projects like Firefox, Firefox OS, Webmaker

- **Be nice**: we are all part of the same community, so be friendly, be welcoming, and generally be a nice person. Be someone that other people want to be around.

- **Be respectful**: We're a diverse group (from all over Tunisia!), so we're not going to agree all the time. Remember to be respectful and constructive with your communication to your fellow Mozillians. Don't get into fights, don't make personal attacks, don't vent or rant unconstructively.

- **Be constructive**: __Everyone__ should take responsibility for the community. Take the initiative to diffuse tension and stop a potential flamewar, fight or negative thread _as early as possible_. No one has the right to share our internal misunderstanding in public.

- **Be collaborative**: Work together! We can learn a lot from each other. Share knowledge, update the etherpads, help each other out.

- **Participate**: This is YOUR community, so be a part of it! Join in on discussions, show up for in-person meetings regularly, offer feedback, and offer to help implement that feedback!

- **Step down considerately**: If you're an organizer, or have some form of responsibility in running a project or the whole community (ie. you're running the website), be aware of your own constraints. We all know that life can get busy, so if you know that a new job or family situation will impact your ability to help the community, find a way to step down gracefully. _Make sure someone can take over for you_, and transfer the relevant information (contacts, passwords, etc.) for a smooth transition.

## Mailing lists, IRC and Telegram

Online discussions has some etiquette to be aware of and follow.

- Think before you send. Does this message need to go to tens of people on a mailing list?
- Do not send messages to the whole list that only need to go to one person.
- Keep off topic conversations to a minimum.
- Do not send spam. Do not advertise or promote personal projects which are off topic.
